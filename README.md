# barekit
Rust base code to boot in EFI and/or bare metal and/or Arm Trusted Firmware

While it is functional, this project lacks proper build instructions in particular
for U-Boot and ARM Trusted Firmware.

It is my first Rust program so it needs a lot of changes to make it tryly Rust.
Actually I haven't been able to implement some design patterns because of my
lack of Rust comprehension.

The project is thus not in a state where I can support it and accept pull requests
but it is my goal to make this happen in the next few weeks (today is Jan 30, 2023).
